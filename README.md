# **Overview of repository**

This repositiory includes a collection of analysis code used in our study: Stable cortical body maps before and aftrer arm amputation. I've uploaded a jupyter notebook for how we plotted each panel in the 3 main-text figures. The associated dataframes used for plotting are located here (https://osf.io/s9hc2/files/osfstorage#). If you have questions regarding the code used to generate any of the dataframes on OSF, feel free to reach out.
