# **Overview of repository**

This repositiory includes a collection of analysis code used in our study: *Stable cortical body maps before and aftrer arm amputation*. I've uploaded a jupyter notebook: NatureNeuroscience_analyses.ipynb, which includes cells for how we plotted each panel in the 3 main-text figures. The sole exception being panels with brain images. However, we provide a comprehensive step-wise protocol for how these were generated in the Methods section of the paper. For the provided code, the associated dataframes used for plotting are located here (https://osf.io/s9hc2/files/osfstorage#). If you have questions regarding the code used to generate any of the OSF dataframes, feel free to reach out.
